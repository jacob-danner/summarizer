# PDF Summarization

### This site is a work in progress...

### Functionality:
* upload pdf to s3
* render images of each pdf page
* allow user to draw bounding boxes over the text sections in a pdf

### What's the point?
* Eventually, the goal is to be able to draw bounding boxes over the text in a pdf, then get a summary of the document
* The frontend is nearly complete, but there is still a good amount of serverless backend work to do
